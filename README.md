# Elevated Engagement AI — Brand Guidelines

## Domain
elevatedengagement.ai

## Brand Positioning
Premium AI consultancy for home service businesses. Not mass-market SaaS — boutique, results-driven, partner-level.

## Color Palette
| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Primary (Deep Navy) | Dark authority blue | `#0B1D3A` |
| Accent (Electric Amber) | Warm, energetic gold | `#F59E0B` |
| Secondary (Slate) | Cool professional gray | `#475569` |
| Light Background | Off-white warmth | `#F8FAFC` |
| Surface | Clean white | `#FFFFFF` |
| Success Green | Results/metrics | `#10B981` |
| Text Primary | Near-black | `#0F172A` |
| Text Secondary | Muted slate | `#64748B` |

**Why this palette:** Navy conveys trust and authority (like a financial advisor). Amber/gold feels premium and warm — approachable for blue-collar owners who distrust "tech bro" aesthetics. No neon. No gradients-for-gradients-sake.

## Typography
- **Headings:** Inter (700, 600) — clean, modern, professional
- **Body:** Inter (400) — highly readable
- **Fallback:** system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif

## Tone of Voice
- **Direct and confident** — these owners don't have time for fluff
- **Results-focused** — always tie back to revenue, leads, time saved
- **Peer-to-peer** — talk like a business partner, not a vendor
- **No jargon** — say "never miss a call" not "omnichannel AI orchestration"
- **Empathetic** — acknowledge how hard they work

## Logo Direction
- Clean wordmark "ELEVATED" with subtle upward element
- Mark could be an upward arrow or rising bar chart abstracted

## Photography/Imagery
- Real tradespeople at work (not stock-photo perfect)
- Clean workspaces, trucks, job sites
- Warm lighting, authentic moments

## Files
- `index.html` — Single-page site
- `styles.css` — All styles
- `script.js` — Interactions and animations

## Deployment
Static HTML — deploy to any host (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, etc.)
No build step required.
